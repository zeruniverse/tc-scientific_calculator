tc-scientific-calculator
========================
It's a team-work project for a basic C course completed by my two other team-mates and me.
We've implemented standard calculations, scientific calculations, statistics, high-precision calculations and hex conversion.
The program should be compiled by TC 2.0.
When running on WIN7 or WIN8, use DOSBOX and set CPU CORE:dynamic SYCLEï¼šmax.
