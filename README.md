tc-scientific-calculator
========================
It's a team-work project for a basic C course completed by my two other team-mates and me.
We've implemented standard calculations, scientific calculations, statistics, high-precision calculations and hex conversion.
The program should be compiled by TC 2.0.
When running on WIN7 or WIN8, use DOSBOX and set CPU CORE:dynamic SYCLE：max.

=======================
复制所有文件到TC2.0目录，设置工程为calc.PRJ,即可编译运行。
Copy all files into TC2.0 main folder, and set the project file as calc.PRJ. Then, compile and have fun.
