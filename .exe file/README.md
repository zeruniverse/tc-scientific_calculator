Oops, seems Github refuse .exe file. So I rename it from [CALC.EXE] to [CALC.EXE.needrename] which means you should delete [.needrename] before running it.
Please notice this .exe file is a 16-bit program and cannot execute directly on systems like Windows 7.  
I suggest to use DosBox to execute this executable file.
